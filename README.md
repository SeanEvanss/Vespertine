First Android application I ever coded

This simple Android application mainly takes advantage of the data.gov API to support several nightlife based functins such as:

- Live display over taxis in Singapore
- Live tracker of all public carparks in Singapore with the number of lots vacant
- Bus arrival timing (beta)
- Next train arrival timing (beta)
- "Speed dial" feature for eateries/emergency services

The app is a simple one, focused on consuming API requests, parsing that data 
and intergrating or visually representing in some form (googleMaps etc.)

The app is designed to work in Singapre as most of the APIs called are based there.

I will be updating the project as needed since this app was orginally created almost 3 year ago when I first started. Time has not been kind.
