# Vespertine
Android application I coded for a school project. 

The app is a simple one with several subsystems primarily pulling data via API requests, parsing that data 
and finally intergrating or visually representing in some form (googleMaps etc.)

The app is designed to work in Singapre as most of the APIs called are based there.
